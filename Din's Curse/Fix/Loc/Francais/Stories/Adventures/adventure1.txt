$$LumenLostCity$$

	$$PersonNameWarrior$$ awoke at home and alive, but was considered mentally deluded since he willingly left the safety of the vast lumen territory.  He’d been found unconscious in the rubble, in a large chamber that should have been a plugged tunnel.  He’d failed, and now not only were his friends dead but a forgotten evil was loose.  No one believed his story about the dark elves.
	Brooding and holed away in a library, $$PersonNameWarrior$$ paced between massive, dusty shelves mindlessly reading book titles when one in particular caught his eye.  Its plain spine held no words. He pulled it from the shelf and flipped through the yellowing pages, finding notes on a city called $$LumenLostCity$$, designed for offensive protection and built in ancient times as a precaution against invasion.  These days lumen were complacent, living in safe times or so they still believed.  $$PersonNameWarrior$$ knew the truth. He'd seen the dark elves freed, a great accident leaving him the only survivor, the only witness.
	He searched his grandfather’s detailed map looking for reference points of $$LumenLostCity$$’s location.  If the lumen weren’t going to prepare for the coming war, $$PersonNameWarrior$$ would have to protect them himself, hold off the enemy until his people realized the danger.  This lost and abandoned city might be the key to delaying the coming flood, if only he could find it before it was too late!

Objectives: $$LumenLostCity$$ may hold the key to protecting the lumen people from the coming dark elf hordes.  Find the forgotten city, $$LumenLostCity$$.
