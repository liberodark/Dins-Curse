Zlod – Male Thief
	There’s good, there’s bad, and then there’s $$PersonNameThief$$.  He’s somewhere in the gray.  Once a promising meditation student, he abandoned the craft for something more practical and eventually more exciting.  He knows everyone and can get you anything for a price, unless luck has left his side.  The bounty on his head is quite high in some circles.  Maybe that’s why he’s often in the outlands, in the places where sane lumen dare not go.
