Risto – Male Paladin
	$$PersonNamePaladin$$ joined the paladins as a compromise to ease his parents’ minds.  He was always a carefree, energetic soul, not even having the common sense to fear the outlands.  Despite his loose affiliation with the God Brujar, $$PersonNamePaladin$$ found himself pulled toward great enemies no one acknowledged.  Just because everyone said the traveler, $$PersonNameWarrior$$, was crazier than sun walkers, didn’t make it so.  In his heart, $$PersonNamePaladin$$ knew $$PersonNameWarrior$$ spoke the truth.
