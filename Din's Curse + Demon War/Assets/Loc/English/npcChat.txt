// General chat (stuff anyone can say, like tips)

GeneralSimpleTips-1			"Sometimes, a monster's group is too large to take on at once. If you can draw one away from the group, you'll have a chance."
GeneralSimpleTips-2			"Always be prepared for an attack on the town."
GeneralSimpleTips-3			"If you hear the town bell, hurry back. It means the town is under attack."
GeneralSimpleTips-4			"Imp tribes are territorial against their own kind. Take advantage of the monsters fighting each other."
GeneralSimpleTips-5			"If you start to feel weak, eat something. It really helps."
GeneralSimpleTips-6			"When you don't have time for food, and need a quick boost to survive, try a health potion. They work immediately."
GeneralSimpleTips-7			"When in town, you can heal at Din's altar."
GeneralSimpleTips-8			"Sometimes while adventuring, you'll find life stones and altars underground. Any of these can be used for healing."
GeneralSimpleTips-9			"If you're facing monsters with a particular skill, like lightning, poison, fire or ice, you can always drink a potion to improve your resistance."

GeneralSimpleTips-13			"The best weapons have a high DPS number."

GeneralSimpleTips-15			"If you notice a cave-in beginning over your head, run!"

GeneralLore-1				"Gods breath created life, but it was their blood that created the first race."
GeneralLore-2				"Humans are the first race. All other races are a punishment for forgetting the gods. They need our love and worship."
GeneralLore-3				"The teratai, wood elf, sade, lumen, and dwarf were once passively negligent humans. They are to be pitied. Many are descended from active treachery, and those monster races are to be despised for all time."
GeneralLore-4				"Some say we lost the right to Aleria when we lost the days of the twelve kingdoms."
GeneralLore-5				"No one knows of the first six lost kingdoms, but the seventh, Rimround, is said to have fallen because their one giant lifestone underneath their capital was destroyed. This is why humans don't use lifestones to regenerate after death."
GeneralLore-6				"Of the five kingdoms, the Krieg are the most warlike, but even their might couldn't stop the Fourth Great War."
GeneralLore-7				"Since the Kriegs worship Din, you think more of them would've survived the Fourth Great War."
GeneralLore-8				"I wish some Anza herders would pass through. I'm in the mood for fresh meat."
GeneralLore-9				"Sometimes Anza herders will come after a thunderstorm. They often follow Thaden's mark."
GeneralLore-10				"Tarbes lands were really decimated in the war. The Orcs loathe their goddess, Viedonna."
GeneralLore-11				"Though Tarbes fish, it isn't their only industry. That's why the Belogs are better at it."
GeneralLore-12				"The Belogs are the best fishers on the bloody seas. Without their boats hauling refugees to safety, no one would've survived the war."
GeneralLore-13				"It's only natural the Belogs worship Herodius. He's the only water god."
GeneralLore-14				"The Brechins used to be the richest of the five kingdoms. It'll be a long time before the monsters are rooted from their bejeweled cities."
GeneralLore-15				"The Goddess Arilynvia must be crying over the destruction of the Brechin Kingdom, and with it the world's finest crafters. She is a patron of beauty and art."
GeneralLore-16				"Rumor has it that Din gave the naga to the evil goddess, Erillin, but I don't believe it for a second."
GeneralLore-17				"Din is the mightiest of the gods, and that's why jealous Valta despises him."
GeneralLore-18				"No one is pure enough to escape the notice of the God, Mortus. In the end, we all must die."
GeneralLore-19				"Some blame evil Kracht for the war, but it must of been Hamlec because he favors the orcs."
GeneralLore-20				"Some say the war is a retaliation of the crusades. If only the third war hadn't petered out before the job was done, there'd have been no monsters to rally and destroy the west."
GeneralLore-21				"Some say the elf, Drelianlis, left a great treasure in Jorvik. If he did, surely the monsters have plundered it by now."
GeneralLore-22				"It's strange seeing so many races on the roads, yet I haven't seen any dwarves in a long while."
GeneralLore-23				"They say the dwarves had as much trouble as we did in the west. The fourth war had a long reach."
GeneralLore-24				"In the First Great War, Greta Hillard, a priest of Din, saved the God's son, Thaden. They say she saved the world from Din's wrath."
GeneralLore-25				"The barbarian Retter Ketill was a reluctant hero during the First Great War. When your gods need you, there is little choice."
GeneralLore-26				"There hasn't been a dwarf hero since Dolf Mudbeard Meadowguard during the First Great War, and he doesn't count because he was raised by humans in Morgenberg."
GeneralLore-27				"Damek Havelock was the greatest ice mage of the ages. I would give my right arm to get a'hold of Whirlwind, his staff during the Second Great War."
GeneralLore-28				"They say Brenna Burleigh, a wild fire mage and heroine of the Second Great War, found her amazing staff, Midnight, while traveling through Adder Mountains. Without Midnight, she'd never have destroyed the dark elves evil altars of darkness."
GeneralLore-29				"Most have never seen lumen, but there was one cartographer who traveled the surface. Tover Edelsteen was a hero in both the Second and Third Great War."
GeneralLore-30				"The barbarian, Sven Bjorr, was an amazing fighter with two swords back in the days of the Second Great War. With a rich family and magician friends, he collected many magical pieces, both weapons and armor."
GeneralLore-31				"While still a prince, King Alek Carmelo led his father's troops in the crusade to vanquish all monster races from the face of Aleria and began the Third Great War."
GeneralLore-32				"Even though a sade, Dez Dazd was friend to King Alek Carmelo and hero in the Third Great War, history will always remember him as a jokester who played games and caused trouble everywhere he went."
GeneralLore-33				"The elven pair, Drelianlis and Lulansal, were heroes both in their youths during the Third Great War and in our last war which we almost lost."
GeneralLore-34				"The worst naga in the history of the world is Shankar Lalitashwa. He tricked the gods and stole away Din's son for a time."
GeneralLore-35				"The naga have hated Din since the dawn of time."
GeneralLore-36				"Though dark elves are rare on the surface world, we've seen our share of their horror."
GeneralLore-37				"Dark elf Fuse Douleur, at the goddess Valta's promptings, made the statue that trapped the god, Thaden."
GeneralLore-38				"None know what became of the dark elf, Aversion Kerytic, after the end of the First Great War."
GeneralLore-39				"It was the Dark elf Fuse Douleur who blackened our skies with Valta's evil magic during the Second Great War."
GeneralLore-40				"They say the two evil leaders of the last war, Ciglio the Necromancer and Draaien the Orc, went to war with each other of the spoils of conquest, and that is how we were able to take back the west."
GeneralLore-41				"There is no human more vial than Ciglio Chandmir, though they say he's dead now, killed by his one time ally, Draaien the Grimp."
GeneralLore-42				"Orcs aren't known for leadership, except for Draaien the Grimp. This is why despite their vast numbers, they normally can't sustain a war."
GeneralLore-43				"The old legends speak of great dragons, but there's no proof such an animal ever existed."
