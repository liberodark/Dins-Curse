For movement and attacking you can hold down the left mouse button to continue the current action.\n\nYou can also setup up to 3 skills in the slots in the lower right corner of the screen to use when you right click on a monster. Right clicking uses the skill in the bottom slot. Use the up and down arrow keys to change which order these are in."

That's you, thanks to Din, whether you like it or not. You will save the town when you have completed all of their quests.\n\nYou also have another goal. Din has cursed you. He will not release you from his service until you have redeemed yourself. Talk to Din in town for more information."

HelpTitleStash				"Stash"
HelpTextStash				"The stash is your extra inventory space where you can store whatever items you want.\n\nNote: Only bags can go directly into the stash.  Any type of item can go into these bags though."

HelpTitleSharedStash			"Shared Stash"
HelpTextSharedStash			"Your shared stash is shared by all of your players that you have created.\n\nNote: Only bags can go directly into the stash.  Any type of item can go into these bags though."

HelpTitleCharacterScreen		"Character Screen"
HelpTextCharacterScreen			"The character screen shows the basic stats of your character.  Place the mouse cursor over anything that you want more information about."

HelpTitleSkillsScreen			"Skills Screen"
HelpTextSkillsScreen			"The skill screen shows all of the skills available for your character class.  A gold border around the skill icon means that you have that skill.  Notice that there are multiple tabs at the bottom.  A full class will have 3 tabs where as a hybrid class will only have 2."

HelpTitleBuyingSkills			"Buying Skills"
HelpTextBuyingSkills			"The skills are not arranged in a skill tree.  All of the skills are available at the very beginning, but they each have a different point cost.  In general, the lower the skill is on the screen the more points it costs.  For each skill level, the point cost increases by one compared to the last skill level.  Buying a skill also costs some amount of money based on the point cost."

HelpTitleSkillTypes			"Skill Types"
HelpTextSkillTypes			"There are two types of skills: passive and active.  Passive skills are skills that automatically work with no input needed from the player, assuming you have the skill of course.  Active skills only work when the player uses them in the appropriate way.  The easiest way to use a skill is to add it to your hotkey bar and press the associated hotkey or add it to your 3 right click skill slots. Passive skills have a blue border around them on the skills screen."

HelpTitleVendors			"Vendors"
HelpTextVendors				"There can be many vendors or even no vendors in town. There are also various different types of vendors like small items vendors, armorsmiths, and weaponsmiths. They each carry different items, but you can sell any item to any of the vendors for the same price.\n\nTo buy an item, just move the item from the vendor's inventory to your own, right click on the item, or use the buy hotkey (defaults to space).\n\nTo sell an item, just move the item from your inventory to the vendor's or hit the sell hotkey (defaults to space).\n\nYou can also identify all of your unidentified items or repair items here for a price. Only armorsmiths and weaponsmiths can repair items."

HelpTitleGambler			"Gambler"
HelpTextGambler				"The gambler allows you to gamble on items.  To gamble, just buy the item like normal and if you are lucky it will be a magical item worth more than what you paid for."

HelpTitleQuestGivers			"Quest Givers"
HelpTextQuestGivers			"Each town usually has four main quest givers: the warmaster, the steward, the apothecary, and Din (the god that has cursed you). In general, they each carry different types of quests.\n\nAlso, sometimes the other NPCs in town will offer personal quests."

HelpTitleItemRarity			"Item Rarities"
HelpTextItemRarity			"Items come in many different rarities or types: ^c004normal^c145, ^c002common^c145, ^c005rare^c145, ^c008set^c145, ^c006elite^c145, ^c147artifacts^c145, and ^c121legendary^c145.\n\n^c004Normal^c145 items are just that, normal.\n\n^c002Common^c145 and ^c005rare^c145 magic items have some random magical enhancements with ^c005rare^c145 items usually having more.\n\n^c008Set^c145 items belong to a group of items.  If you can find and equip all of the items from a set, you will get some bonus enhancements.  Many sets also have a partial bonus if you can equip part of the set.\n\n^c006Elite^c145 items are items that are named, have enchantments that are always the same, and usually are very powerful.\n\n^c147Artifact^c145 items are very similar to elite items but usually have at least one extra enhancement so they are even more powerful.\n\n^c121Legendary^c145 items are the holy grail. They are the same as their artifact counterpart except they have an additional random magic modifier."

HelpTitleLowHealth			"Low Health"
HelpTextLowHealth			"There are many ways to regain health when your health gets too low.\n\nTypically the easiest way is to eat some food.  Eating food will slowly regenerate your health and food is relatively cheap.\n\nThe fastest way to regain health is to drink a health potion.  Health potions instantly give you health but are relatively expensive.\n\nThe cheapest way to regain your health is to use Din's altar in town.  Using Din's altar regenerates your health fairly quickly and is free but you have to be in town of course.\n\nAnd last but not least, some of the classes have different spells that can heal wounds."

HelpTitleLevelUp			"Level Up"
HelpTextLevelUp				"Each time you increase in level you get more attribute and skill points to distribute however you want.\n\nTo use your attribute points, open up your character page (defaults to the C key), and press the + button next to the attribute you want to increase.  You get 5 attribute points each level.\n\nTo use your skills points, open your skill page (defaults to the S key), and press the + button next to the skill you want to increase.  The higher your character's level the more skill points you get per level.  Also note, that skills cost more and more with each skill level and that they also cost a certain amount of money to increase."

HelpTitleWonGame			"Won Game"
HelpTextWonGame				"When you have saved a town, you can finish up whatever you need to and can then start a new town. Make sure you open your reward chest in the center of town though. Once you are done, you can start a new town by clicking on the blinking won game icon.  Don't worry, your characters and items all carry over into the new town."

HelpTitleDeath				"Death"
HelpTextDeath				"Death is inevitable in Din's Curse.  When you die you can always resurrect through Din's power though (unless you are playing hardcore).\n\nWhen killed you will incur a small XP debt penalty.  This means you get less experience until you work off the XP debt.  If you go and retrieve your soulstone that dropped when you died, the XP debt will be decreased. Soulstones are not saved so be sure to pick them up quickly."

HelpTitleMoney				"Money"
HelpTextMoney				"Money in the world of Aleria comes in the form of copper pieces (^c026CP^c145), silver pieces (^c128SP^c145), and gold pieces (^c061GP^c145).\n\n^c026100 Copper Pieces^c145 = ^c1281 Silver Piece^c145\n^c128100 Silver Pieces^c145 = ^c0611 Gold Piece^c145\n"

HelpTitleFindCombatPercents		"Find and Combat Percents"
HelpTextFindCombatPercents		"Item find, magic find, critical hit, crushing blow, and deep wounds bonuses are slightly misleading.  They represent the bonus compared to normal.\n\nFor example, a 100% bonus to critical hits means a 100% better chance than normal, not a 100% chance.  So if your normal critical hit chance is 5% and you have a 100% bonus, the final value will be 10%."

HelpTitleUIScreens			"UI Screens"
HelpTextUIScreens			"Here is a quick list of the main UI screens with their default hotkeys.\n\nCharacter - C\nQuests - Q\nSkills - S\nInventory - I\nMap - M\nJournal - J\nBestiary - B\nMain menu - Esc\nMinimap - Tab\nAll of these also have small buttons at the bottom of the screen."

HelpTitleLocks				"Locks"
HelpTextLocks				"Sometimes doors and chests are locked or stuck. If something is locked and you use it, you will use up one skeleton key automatically and it will unlock.\n\nIf you don't have a key though, you can use your Lock Pick skill if you are a rogue or you will have to bash down the door or bash open the chest. Bashing is the only way to open a stuck door.\n\nTo bash something, simply attack it with any damage type skill you have, including your main attack skill (default 1 key).\n\nBeware though, bashing things open makes a lot of noise which will alert nearby monsters and give you a surprise penalty for a few seconds. Bashing also tends to damage your weapons faster than hitting enemies."

HelpTitleCaveIns			"Cave-ins"
HelpTextCaveIns				"Caves and dungeons are fairly fragile. Large explosions can cause cave-ins which will damage anything underneath them and can block paths. If they get in the way you can attack and destroy them though, just like if they were a monster. Beware though, bashing on rocks with your weapons wears them down faster."

HelpTitleLowMana			"Low Mana"
HelpTextLowMana				"There are many ways to regain mana when your mana pool gets too low.\n\nThe easiest way is to just let it naturally regenerate. This is also the slowest way however.\n\nYou can drink a mana potion to instantly regain some mana.\n\nYou can also drink a drink to regain mana over time. This isn't instant like potions, but it's faster than your normal regeneration rate.\n\nOther than these many classes have various ways to gain mana. Look at your character skills for specifics."

HelpTitleReputation			"Reputation"
HelpTextReputation			"Reputation is very important in Din's Curse since Din will not release you from his curse until you have gained enough reputation.\n\nYou can gain reputation in only one way, by solving quests. However, doing quests for Din and normal towns people are generally worth more reputation.\n\nYou can lose reputation in multiple ways though. Any time you fail a quest, anyone from town dies, or you buy items from a less reputable source you will lose some reputation.\n\nAs an added bonus, each time you go up a reputation level you get a unique item as a reward!"

HelpTitleAcid				"Acid"
HelpTextAcid				"Be very wary of pools of acid and acid based attacks. Acid does way more durability damage to your items than anything else. Acid pools look like small pools of green liquid."

HelpTitleDurability			"Durability"
HelpTextDurability			"Most items have a limited durability before they break. You will be warned when any item gets too worn, but pay attention or something might break at a bad time. Weaponsmiths and armorsmiths in town can repair items for a fee. Attacking some things like doors, chests, and cave ins will cause more damage to your weapons than softer things."

HelpTitleMultiplayer			"Multijoueur"
HelpTextMultiplayer			"For the most part Din's Curse works the same in multiplayer as in singleplayer. The multiplayer experience is designed to be co-op, so you can't hurt other players and things like quests and experience are shared. There are a few differences. You can chat with other players by hitting enter or clicking on the chat button in the lower left of the screen. You can also hover the mouse over the icon in the upper right of the screen to find out information about the game. You can see the locations (either a dot or the level name) of other players on the world map. Each player's health shows up on the right side of the screen. If the player is close enough, left clicking this health bar will select their character and right clicking it will show you their items."

HelpTitleObjectInteraction		"Object Interaction"
HelpTextObjectInteraction		"Many objects in the world can be used and/or destroyed so keep on a look for different types of objects. Many times these are useful, but not always. For example, some things are poisonous or are holding up the ceiling. Causing large explosions near the support beams isn't the smartest of actions to take. Also beware, some types of monsters know how to use some of the objects in the game."

HelpTitleDynamicWorld			"Dynamic World"
HelpTextDynamicWorld			"Unlike most games, Din's Curse has a very dynamic world. Each and every town will be very different. Without giving away any spoilers, when an NPC says do this quick or something might happen, well what ever that something is it will probably happen if you don't do something about it. When an NPC says hurry, they really do mean it. The game will change depending on what is going on in the town when you arrive, what you do, what you don't do, and even what the monsters do. So keep on your toes and solve the town's problems as quick as you can. You are the hero after all."

ShadowsDesc				"This option controls the quality of the\nshadows for your player, NPCs, and monsters.\nSimple shadows just show a roundish blob\nunderneath the character, where as complex\nshadows show a real shadow of the character.\nComplex is the best looking but slowest."

ScreenshotTypeDesc			"This controls what file format screenshots\nare saved as.  TGA is an uncompressed file\nformat so these screenshots will be perfect\nbut really large and most programs don't\nsupport them.  PNG files use lossless\ncompression.  This means they will look\nperfect just like the TGAs, but will be\nsmaller.  Many programs support PNGs.\nJPG is a lossy format.  This means the image\nwill not be exactly what was on the screen,\nbut they usually look pretty close and will\nbe much smaller.  Most programs that deals\nwith images can work with Jpgs.\nRecommendation: keep this on JPG."

AntiAliasingDesc			"Anti aliasing helps fix edges of things from looking so\njaggy (especially long thin things like a sword).  The higher\nthe samples number the better the graphics but the slower\nthe game will be.  This greatly depends on the speed of your\ngraphics card though."
